## Smart Irrigation System Using Arduino Uno

### Project Overview
This smart irrigation system is designed to automate the watering of plants by measuring soil moisture levels and activating a pump motor when the soil becomes dry. The system uses an Arduino Uno microcontroller, a soil moisture sensor, and a pump motor to maintain optimal moisture levels in the soil.

2. **Wire the Relay Module** to the Arduino, ensuring that the relay can switch the pump motor on and off.
3. **Connect the Pump Motor** to the relay module and the external power supply.
4. Double-check all connections to ensure there are no loose wires or short circuits.

### 4. Software Code
The following code reads the soil moisture sensor's output, checks the moisture level, and activates the pump if the soil is dry.

```cpp
#define SOIL_MOISTURE_PIN A0    // Soil Moisture Sensor connected to A0
#define RELAY_PIN 8             // Relay connected to Digital Pin 8
#define DRY_THRESHOLD 500       // Threshold value to trigger watering

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(SOIL_MOISTURE_PIN, INPUT);
  pinMode(RELAY_PIN, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW); // Start with pump off
}

void loop() {
  int soilMoistureValue = analogRead(SOIL_MOISTURE_PIN);
  Serial.print("Soil Moisture Level: ");
  Serial.println(soilMoistureValue);

  // Check if soil is dry
  if (soilMoistureValue > DRY_THRESHOLD) {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH); // Turn pump on
    Serial.println("Pump ON: Soil is dry.");
  } else {
    digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);  // Turn pump off
    Serial.println("Pump OFF: Soil is moist.");
  }

  delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second before the next reading
}
```

#### Explanation of the Code:
- **Pin Definitions**: Sets the pin for soil moisture input and relay output.
- **Setup Function**: Initializes serial communication and sets pin modes.
- **Loop Function**: Reads soil moisture levels, compares to the threshold, and toggles the pump based on the reading.

---

### 5. Working Principle
- The soil moisture sensor measures the soil’s moisture level and outputs an analog signal.
- The Arduino reads this signal and compares it to a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 500).
- If the soil moisture level is below the threshold, indicating dryness, the Arduino activates the relay to turn on the pump motor, watering the soil.
- Once the soil is moist enough, the pump motor is turned off.

---

### 6. Testing and Calibration
1. **Calibration**: Test the soil moisture sensor in dry and wet soil to determine the analog readings for dry and moist conditions. Adjust the `DRY_THRESHOLD` value based on these observations.
2. **Testing**: Run the system and observe the Serial Monitor to check that the pump activates only when needed.
3. **Adjustments**: Modify the threshold or delay settings if the pump activates too frequently or not often enough.

---

### 7. Future Enhancements
- **Power Efficiency**: Use a low-power mode for the Arduino to conserve battery life.
- **Water Level Detection**: Add a water level sensor to ensure the pump doesn’t run when the water reservoir is empty.
- **Mobile App Control**: Integrate a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi module to control and monitor the system via a mobile app.
- **Weather Integration**: Use a rain sensor or link with weather data to avoid watering when it's raining.

### 8. Conclusion
This smart irrigation system is a cost-effective and efficient solution for maintaining plant health. By automating the watering process based on real-time soil moisture data, it conserves water and minimizes manual intervention.
